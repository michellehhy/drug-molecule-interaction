# Predicting Drug-Receptor Interactions and Side Effects

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting drug-receptor interactions and associated side effects using multi-source biological data. 
In the initial phase, data for diabetic drugs is collected, and a baseline prediction model using a Random Forest classifier has been implemented. 
Future developments aim to transition to a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Current Objectives
	•	Primary Goal: Establish a baseline prediction model using a Random Forest classifier on diabetic drug data.
	•	Future Goal: Transition to a GNN-based framework to integrate diverse biological data sources and improve prediction accuracy.

## Next Steps
The upcoming phases will focus on:
	1.	Transition to GNNs: Develop a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model using the current dataset to enable better representation of drug-receptor interactions.
	2.	Integration of Additional Data: Expand the dataset to include more drugs.
	3.	Advanced Predictions: Use multi-label learning and ensemble techniques to improve side-effect prediction.
